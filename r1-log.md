# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Srajat]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 2, Monday, 2022].

Saw post on LinkedIn of people my age starting with #100DaysOfCode challenge. Thought I should give it a try too. Because, why not?
I'll be coding in Apex since Salesforce is what I work on. It is similar to Java though so it'll be easy for me to adapt and learn.
