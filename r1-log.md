# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Srajat]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 2, Monday, 2022].

Saw post on LinkedIn of people my age starting with #100DaysOfCode challenge. Thought I should give it a try too. Because, why not?
I'll be coding in Apex since Salesforce is what I work on. It is similar to Java though so it'll be easy for me to adapt and learn.

## Log

### R1D1

I did 4 programs. 2 from Kunal Kushawaha's list and 2 from interviewbit.com.
These programs were:

1. Find whether a year is leap year or not?
2. Find the HCF and LCM of two numbers.
3. Find the number of Sundays in a week.
4. Find the product of the digits of a number.

I learn that Apex doesn't support '%' operator so instead, I had to use, math.mod(a,b) where a,b stands for a%b. Also, I learnt the algorithm for finding the HCF and LCM of two numbers. I learnt Switch case in Java as well.
