# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 2, Monday, 2022].

Saw post on LinkedIn of people my age starting with #100DaysOfCode challenge. Thought I should give it a try too. Because, why not?
I'll be coding in Apex since Salesforce is what I work on. It is similar to Java though so it'll be easy for me to adapt and learn.

### Day 1: September 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I did 4 programs. 2 from Kunal Kushawaha's list and 2 from interviewbit.com.
These programs were:

1. Find whether a year is leap year or not?
2. Find the HCF and LCM of two numbers.
3. Find the number of Sundays in a week.
4. Find the product of the digits of a number.

I learn that Apex doesn't support '%' operator so instead, I had to use, math.mod(a,b) where a,b stands for a%b. Also, I learnt the algorithm for finding the HCF and LCM of two numbers. I learnt Switch case in Java as well.

**Thoughts** I've recently started this challenge, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 2: September 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I did 4 programs and out of which I needed help with only Fibonacci recursion and little concept of finding a leap year.

I learnt that Recursion is a very deep topic and how it actually forms a stack and then the values are calculated from the bottom and starts retracing back to the top. Also, the odd-even rule question, I did it on my own. I was so glad that I was myself able to form the logic and build the program as well. Well, I'm getting the hang of it. Loving it so far!
