# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 2, Monday, 2022].

Saw post on LinkedIn of people my age starting with #100DaysOfCode challenge. Thought I should give it a try too. Because, why not?
I'll be coding in Apex since Salesforce is what I work on. It is similar to Java though so it'll be easy for me to adapt and learn.

### Day 1: September 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I did 4 programs. 2 from Kunal Kushawaha's list and 2 from interviewbit.com.
These programs were:

1. Find whether a year is leap year or not?
2. Find the HCF and LCM of two numbers.
3. Find the number of Sundays in a week.
4. Find the product of the digits of a number.

I learn that Apex doesn't support '%' operator so instead, I had to use, math.mod(a,b) where a,b stands for a%b. Also, I learnt the algorithm for finding the HCF and LCM of two numbers. I learnt Switch case in Java as well.

**Thoughts** I've recently started this challenge, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

3. [Product of digits](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/product-of-digits/)

### Day 2: September 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I did 4 programs and out of which I needed help with only Fibonacci recursion and little concept of finding a leap year.

I learnt that Recursion is a very deep topic and how it actually forms a stack and then the values are calculated from the bottom and starts retracing back to the top. Also, the odd-even rule question, I did it on my own. I was so glad that I was myself able to form the logic and build the program as well. Well, I'm getting the hang of it. Loving it so far!

### Day 3: September, 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I did:

1. I solved LCM and learnt that we must use long for large numbers on interviewbit.com
2. I did problem on Armstrong Number on interviewbit and in Apex as well.
3. Also, I did Socks Pair problem from Interviewbit.com
4. I did Random Number Generator in Apex as well.

These problems made me realise that there can be multiple approaches to solve a problem. I learnt datatype conversion in Apex. Also, I learnt that there can be hashsets and maps used, even in simple Math problems.

### Day 4: September 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I did shapes problems today from Raj Vikramaditya's A-Z DSA Course. I made two shapes which took me around 30 minutes to get to the desired results. I did them very efficiently and learnt how to make use of for loops in making the shapes look.

1. I did ShapeV in Java
2. ShapeDiamond in Java


### Day 5: September 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I did only 1 program today i.e. Automorphic Number. I'm feeling regretful that I was not able to do any coding stuff today.
